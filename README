This program was made for my university's Operating Systems [2] project.
Ftext (format text) allows you to format text like a newspaper article.
Text formatting is done using the specified parameters (see OPTIONS).
Each column of the resulting text is formatted according to the following rules:

1) Words in the line are aligned to the edges if they are not part of the last line of the paragraph.

2) Words in the line are aligned to the left side of the column if they are part of the last line of the paragraph.

For example:

    "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
    sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. "

Produces the following output:

    lorem ipsum dolor sit
    amet,     consectetur
    adipiscing  elit, sed
    incididunt  ut labore
    et    dolore    magna
    aliqua.
